## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later recommended): Required to run the React application
- npm or yarn: Package managers for installing dependencies
- Firebase account: Required for authentication and database services

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todos-list.git
   cd todos-list
   ```
   This downloads the codebase to your local machine and navigates to the project directory.

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
   This installs all required packages defined in package.json.

3. Create a Firebase project
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Create a new project by clicking "Add project" and following the setup wizard
   - Set up Authentication with Email/Password method:
     - Click "Authentication" > "Sign-in method" > Enable Email/Password
   - Create a Firestore database:
     - Click "Firestore Database" > "Create database" > Choose mode (start in test mode for development)

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Firebase configuration
   ```
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
   ```
   You can find these values in your Firebase project settings > General > Your apps > SDK setup and configuration.

5. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```
   This launches the app in development mode with hot reloading enabled.

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser
   The page will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.

### Firebase Configuration

In the `src/auth/firebaseConfig.js` file, ensure your Firebase configuration is properly set up:

```javascript
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  projectId: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
  appId: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = getAuth(app);
export const db = getFirestore(app);
```
This initializes Firebase in your application using environment variables for security.
